    "text" : "Reverse engineering the brain is one of the National Academy of Engineers’ 21st Century Challenges—a list of complex problems that are tightly intertwined with engineering and the future. Medical and technical personnel around the world are working toward solutions that will have applications in artificial intelligence, medical treatments, and prosthetics. The knowledge of this challenge is crucial to garnering public support and increased funding. Our goal is to inform and gain the interest of the general public and potential engineers through an interactive art exhibit that converts brain wave activity generated from listening to music into art."
